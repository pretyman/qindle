This project is aimed at porting a Qt embedded framework to Amazon Kindle DX, and porting other useful applications to this framework.

### Same Project, Different Target ###
The project is live again. This time it will be a Qt embedded framework for the BoYue E-ink reader.
It turns out the Qt framework is too heavy for low-end devices. This framework will be only used in utilities. The main reader program is planned to be a port of [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader).

### Patch For Version 0.1 ###
There are many bugs in version 0.1, but some of them are fixed in this patch, including:
Poor quality of PDF rendering.
Unable to open TOC.
Unable to save bookmark.

### Version 0.1 Released ###
This version adds a viewer that can open PDF, DJVU, EPUB and CHM files, which makes this framework somewhat useful :-)
